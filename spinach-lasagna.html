    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kicking Monday off with my White Pesto Spinach Lasagna. Simply the BEST. Layers of creamy cheese bechamel sauce with basil pesto, spinach, and caramelized mushrooms. 
        This dinner is always a favorite with our Christmas crew. It’s a great meal for entertaining, just make it ahead of time, and bake it off before guests arrive. 
         Creamy, cheesy, spinach lasagna flavored with a hint of nutmeg and a combination of besciamella (that's Italian for "white sauce") and fresh ricotta. While I'll often opt for the ease and convenience of no-boil lasagna noodles, today we're going to go with store-bought fresh pasta. </p>

            <li>5. Spread 1/4 of the cheese sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with 3-4 lasagna sheets. Spread with 1/2 the ricotta cheese mixture, another 1/4 of the cheese sauce, and half of the mushrooms.

Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
